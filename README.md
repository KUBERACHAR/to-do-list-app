## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Adding Tasks**: Users input a task and click "Add". Empty inputs trigger a warning.
2. **Marking Complete**: Clicking a task toggles its completed state.
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Each task has a delete button to remove it.
4. **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and reloaded on page refresh.
